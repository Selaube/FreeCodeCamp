        <h3>Here's a time line of John von Neumann's life:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1903</strong> - Born in Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary</li>
            <li><strong>1925</strong> - Received his degree in Chemical Engineering at the Swiss Federal Institute in
                Zurich</li>
            <li><strong>1925</strong> - His work “An Axiomatization of Set Theory” demonstrated axiomatic set theory and
                logics, problems in quantum mechanics, and special mathematical functions</li>
            <li><strong>1926</strong> - Also went on to obtain his Doctorate in mathematics at University of Budapest
            </li>
            <li><strong>1928</strong> - Published “Theory of Parlor Games,” a key paper in the field of game theory.
                "Game Theory" focused on elements of bluffing and probability theory</li>
            <li><strong>1932</strong> - Gave a lecture at IAS in 1932: “On Certain Equations of Economics and a
                Generalization of Brouwer’s Fixed Point Theorem." It was about seminal contribution to linear and
                nonlinear programming in economics and this was later published in 1937</li>
            <li><strong>1933</strong> - Became one of the first professors at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS),
                Princeton, New Jersey</li>
            <li><strong>1940</strong> - Introduced a theory of rings of operators in his development of mathematical
                techniques suited to quantum phenomena</li>
            <li><strong>1943</strong> - J. Robert Oppenheimer invited John to work on the Manhattan Project. He helped
                work on the hydrodynamics and implosion
                design for an atomic bomb</li>
            <li><strong>1944</strong> - Modified the U.S. Army’s hard-wired ENIAC to run as a stored-program machine.
                Later, he then lobbied to build an improved computer at IAS.</li>
            <li><strong>1946</strong> - Along with Klaus Fuchs, John filed a secret patent on "Improvement in Methods
                and Means for Utilizing Nuclear Energy." It outlined the specifications of using a fission bomb to
                compress fusion fuel for nuclear implosion</li>
            <li><strong>1950</strong> - Became a consultant to the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG). He advised
                the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the US Secretary of Defense for developing new technologies and nuclear
                weapons</li>
            <li><strong>1954</strong> - For two years, Served as a member of the Atomic Energy Commission. He was an
                architect of the policy of nuclear deterrence. This was
                developed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s administration</li>
            <li><strong>1956</strong> - Received the Medal for Freedom in 1956. Also, he received the Enrico Fermi Award
                and Albert Einstein Commemorative Award</li>
            <li><strong>1957</strong> - died, 18 months after diagnosed with cancer</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics in the development of
                functional analysis, and a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular
                automata, the universal constructor and the digital computer."</p>
